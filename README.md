**PDF Chatbot with LLaMA Index**

This project demonstrates how to build a chatbot capable of handling multiple PDF files. The chatbot parses the PDF files, stores their content in a vector index (using the LLaMA index), and provides a question-and-answer feature for users.

**Features**

**Multi-PDF Support**: Upload and process multiple PDF files simultaneously.

**PDF Parsing**: Extracts text and content from PDFs for analysis.

**Vector Index Storage**: Uses LLaMA index for efficient information retrieval.

**Question-Answer Feature**: Enables users to ask questions based on the PDF content and receive accurate answers.
