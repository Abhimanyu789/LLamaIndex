Ashtakavarga means eightfold categorization. It depicts eightfold strength of planets excluding the nodes of\\nthe Moon but including the ascendant. It is worked out according to certain well-established rules for measuring the\\nplanetary strength. The strength of each planet and the power and intensity of their influence depends upon the\\nlocation of other planets and the ascendant in relation to it. Eight full points are assigned to each planet. They can\\nobtain strength varying from zero to 8 points which, plotted on different signs in a chart, determine the possibility of a\\ntransiting planet in inducing auspicious or other effects during its sojourn in a particular sign. Events and their timings\\nare to a large extent determined by the positioning of particular points. Depending on their negative or positive\\ninfluences the native can take remedial measures or pre-empt unpleasant possibilities, just by being aware of the likely\\nconsequences.

In the second method, the end of the period is taken.\\nIn the case of Gulika, the sub-planet of Saturn, a third method is also available to calculate the longitude of the\\ndhumadi group of subplanets based on fixed values of rise time as given below.\\nDays\\nBirth during day\\nBirth during night\\nSunday\\n26\\nGhati (Nazhika) \\n10\\n Ghati (Nazhika)\\nMonday\\n22\\n6\\nTuesday\\n18\\n2\\nWednesday\\n14\\n26\\nThursday\\n10\\n22\\nFriday\\n6\\n18\\nSaturday\\n2\\n14\\nPage \\n94', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

They express a wide range of emotions, and are \\nusually very aware of what is going on for them emotionally. Fours are not only emotional, but are emotionally \\ndriven; they find it very difficult to do anything if they are not “feeling it.” They can be sensitive to others’ feelings, \\nas well, but for the Four, their own emotions are at the center of their universe.\\nSeeking the Unattainable. Fours are predisposed to want what isn’t available. Fours’ core emotion of envy means \\nthat they are plagued by feelings that others have something which is missing from their own lives; the phrase “the\\ngrass is always greener on the other side of the fence” could be the personal slogan of the Four. Fours not only \\ncovet what others have, but tend to devalue anything that feels within their own reach. For the Four, what is \\nattractive is unattainable, and what is attainable is unattractive.\\nFeelings of Inadequacy. The Four’s susceptibility to envy relates to their own beliefs about themselves. Although \\nthey may not consciously realize it, Fours have a deep belief that what is good and worthwhile in the world is \\nseparate and inaccessible to them. They feel that who they are and what they have is unsatisfactory, and that \\nother people are somehow better and more whole than they are. Their envy connects with this sense of deep \\ninadequacy; they fear that on some level, they are unworthy and do not deserve to be happy.\\nMelancholy. It is not surprising, then, that Fours often deploy their emotional awareness to dig into their sadness \\nand isolation. Fours often do not understand why they feel so dissatisfied, and their natural tendency to \\nintrospection drives them to spend considerable time and energy reflecting on their failures and regrets in an \\neffort to connect with their pain. In particular, Fours dwell on broken relationships, appreciating the bittersweet \\nfeeling of losing a person who was once deeply loved. They are inclined to focus on what is lost or missing, \\ncreating an atmosphere of never-ending grief.\\nArtistic Sensibility. Although not all Fours are artists, Fours typically appreciate art as a means of self-expression. \\nEven if they are not artistically inclined, Fours seek out creative ways to communicate their feelings, reactions, \\nexperiences, and identity.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

They feel that other people have access to some aspect of life that they themselves are shut out of. \\nThis causes feelings of disconnection as well as envy and jealousy. Fours are apt to covet what others have and \\nassume that other people are happier, more connected, and more complete.\\nFours are prone to sadness and even depression. Although Fours don’t necessarily enjoy being sad, they tend to \\nfeel that sadness is an emotion that should be fully experienced, rather than avoided or repressed. For healthy \\nFours, this means that they are aware of their sadness and take the time they need to process it. Unhealthy Fours, \\nhowever, can tend to wallow in negative emotion until they become completely incapacitated by it.\\nFours often feel wistful and melancholy. They tend to have bittersweet memories of the past and may even get a \\npeculiar enjoyment out of remembering painful past relationships or circumstances. While some may see this as \\nmorbid, Fours feel that these experiences make up a significant and authentic part of who they are. They do not \\nmind taking a stroll down memory lane, even when the road is rough.\\nWhen Fours feel upbeat and hopeful, it is often about some future possibility.

Fours’ idealism means that the reality of a dream, once \\nactualized, is usually disappointing—but that doesn’t stop Fours from hoping that true satisfaction might be just \\naround the bend.\\nChildhood Origins\\nIn childhood, most Fours experienced a sense of loss or abandonment. This can be a profound loss, such as a \\ndeath of a loved one, or something more subtle, like the loss of attention from parents when a younger sibling \\narrives. The Four’s characteristic envy has its origins in this early sense of something missing.\\nIn relation to their families, Fours often feel like the black sheep or the outsider. They may not identify as being \\nmuch like either parent, and tend to feel that the people closest to them don’t understand them very well at all. \\nThis feeling of being misunderstood creates distance between the Four and other people, which echoes into their \\nrelationships as adults.\\nThe Four’s search for identity also originates in childhood.

One important thing to remember is that personality \\ntraits are never all good, or all bad. Every trait has its possible benefits and potential downsides—it's all in how you \\nuse it.\\nYour Top 3 Personality Superpowers\\nWhich of your personality traits are your biggest assets? We all have our strengths and weaknesses, and many \\npsychologists believe that they key to success is not in trying to overcome all your flaws, but rather in making the \\nmost of what you have going for you. Let's look now at some traits that you may be able to deploy to your benefit.\\nAs you read over this section, remember that even beneficial personality traits can work against you if they are \\noverused. For each superpower below, you'll see how it can benefit your life, as well as how it may backfire if not \\nkept in balance.\", mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

You wouldn't dream of doing something without thinking it through, and you typically have a deeper \\nunderstanding of the situation than the people around you—simply because you take the time to really think about \\nit. While you may sometimes be accused of overthinking things (and in fact, you are prone to getting stuck in \\nanalysis when you should be taking action), for the most part, your thoughtfulness allows you to understand more \\ndeeply, predict more accurately, and set more detailed goals. Rather than react too quickly, you take time to \\nponder, with the result that your choices tend to be well thought-out and carefully considered.\\nIndividualism. You're not one to follow the herd, and you make decisions based on your own values and goals, not \\nthe expectations of other people. You think of yourself as unique and different from others, which can sometimes \\nmake you feel somewhat distant, but this attitude gives you original perspectives on things and makes you more \\nlikely to make choices that are right for you, instead of simply doing what's expected of you. \\nSelf Improvement. You see yourself as a work in progress, and are always willing and motivated to learn \\nsomething new. You want to understand how to be the best you can be—whether at work, in your relationships, or \\nin your own mind. You enjoy exploring psychology and other systems of understand and improving oneself, and \\nyou are probably a voracious reader and lifelong learner. Self-acceptance may not be a strength of yours; because \\nyou see yourself as an ongoing project, you may never feel really satisfied with who you are now. Be mindful of \\nrecognizing your progress, and give yourself regular pats on the back as you press forward on your quest for self-\\nactualization.\\nYour Top 3 Personality Blindspots\\nNow, let's take a look at those aspects of your personality that are likely to get in your way, cause you stress, or \\ninterfere with you achieving what you want. These are traits that you need to be especially conscious of, as they \\ncan tend to sidetrack you if you are not paying attention.\\nAs with your strengths, these traits are not always negative; in fact, by being aware of them, you'll be more able to \\nturn them to your advantage. The goal is not to eliminate these qualities from your personality; rather, you want to \\nexplore and master them so you can choose the most effective behavior for yourself in any given situation.\\n20\\n0\\n 2\\n 4\\n 6\\n 8\\n 10\\n 12\\n 14\\n 16\\n 18\\n 20\\nANALYSIS\\n20\\n0\\n 2\\n 4\\n 6\\n 8\\n 10\\n 12\\n 14\\n 16\\n 18\\n 20\\nINDIVIDUAL\\n20\\n0\\n 2\\n 4\\n 6\\n 8\\n 10\\n 12\\n 14\\n 16\\n 18\\n 20\\nIMPROVE\", mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

You feel separate from other people, and tend to think that others can\\'t truly understand you. Most \\nlikely, you grew up around people—either family or social groups—who made you feel like an outsider. There\\'s \\nnothing wrong with appreciating yourself as a unique person, but everyone needs a sense of belonging. You\\'ll live \\na fuller life if you put some time and energy into creating a network of kindred spirits. Somewhere out there are \\npeople who are just as offbeat as you are, and who will make you feel like you\\'re finally understood.\\nPessimism. You may consider yourself realistic, not pessimistic, but the fact is that you often expect things to turn\\nout poorly. While this means you\\'re not usually disappointed—you never got your hopes up in the first place—it also\\nmeans that you\\'re hesitant to go out on a limb and try something that may not work out. You may miss out on \\nvaluable opportunities because you fail to think about the potential upside, and you may satisfy yourself with less-\\nthan-optimal circumstances because you don\\'t imagine that there\\'s a better alternative. Remember that most \\nforward progress starts with a positive vision for the future. There\\'s nothing wrong with being aware of the risks, \\nbut a balanced viewpoint takes into account the potential benefits as well. \\nPresent Focus. You are a grounded sort of person, tuned into what\\'s happening now. You don\\'t spend much time \\nthinking about the future or imagining what might come next. You\\'re way ahead of those multitasking folks who \\nstruggle to \"stay present,\" but you can also be a bit blindsided by life. Without a vision for the future, your path \\nthrough life can be haphazard, and you may make decisions based on circumstance rather than a cohesive plan \\nfor what you want. Although nobody can predict the future, that doesn\\'t make thinking ahead a waste of time. \\nMaking a point to think about how you\\'d like your life to go will make it more likely that you get what you want.\\nMaking the Most of Who You Are\\nThe Enneagram presents a rich opportunity to discover what drives us, what matters to us, and who we are at our \\ncore. You may have found that your Enneagram report confirmed some of what you already knew about yourself. \\nYou may have also found words for aspects of yourself that you were aware of, but didn\\'t know how to describe. \\nAnd you may have also seen some sides to yourself that you were uncomfortable with.\\n17\\n0\\n 2\\n 4\\n 6\\n 8\\n 10\\n 12\\n 14\\n 16\\n 18\\n 20\\nALIENATION\\n16\\n0\\n 2\\n 4\\n 6\\n 8\\n 10\\n 12\\n 14\\n 16\\n 18\\n 20\\nPESSIMISM\\n10\\n0\\n 2\\n 4\\n 6\\n 8\\n 10\\n 12\\n 14\\n 16\\n 18\\n 20\\nPRESENT', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",
